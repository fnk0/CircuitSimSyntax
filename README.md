#### CircuitSimSyntax
====================

Small syntax plugin for circuitSim to be used with Sublime Text. 
CircuitSim is a java program to simulate circuits at gate level writen by Dr. David Cline to be used on his Computer Systems class @ Oklahoma State University.

#### Usage

Create a folder inside the packages folder with the desired name for the syntas such as CircuitSim
Download the .tmLanguage file and place inside the created folder.

To enable the Syntax Highlight feature save a file as ````.csim```` or inside subline go to View -> Syntax -> CircuitSim

###### Auto Complete

I've also added some auto complete feature for the keywords. The auto complete is accomplished by pressing TAB 
Ex: if you type "in" and press TAB would generate inputNames { }

To use the auto complete feature place the file CircuitSimCompletions.sublime-completions inside the root of the packages folder. 

Enjoy :)
